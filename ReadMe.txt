	Game Information

	

1. Used Phaser.Js to implement this game.
2. Overall not a good approach used by me.
3. Mapped the grid with 22 - 10 array
4. Problem with destroying the blocks - destroys blocks partially. Not able to fix this bug.
5. Couldn't follow design patterns and oops concept.
6. The score is updated whenever the line is completed.
7. Initially tried with physics - Tried to do as we do in unity 3d. Didn't work out.
8. Please check the logs for the array mapped- prints when a block settles down


 Could have done better.


Thanks,
